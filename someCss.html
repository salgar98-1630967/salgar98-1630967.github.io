<font size="6">Hello, my name is Shilpa and this is my INFO 101 assignment. I enjoy INFO 101 as it teaches me new things every single class. I mainly took INFO 101 for the writing credit, but am glad I took it because I am learning a lot more than I expected. I think everyone should take INFO 101, or some version of it because it is a good entry level class that teaches you a lot in a short amount of time.</font>
